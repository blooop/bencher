create a new inputvar type call YamlSweep

It should accept a path to a yaml file in the constructor.
and the values it sweeps over should be the top level keys in the yaml and return contents of that key when iterating through.

create an example that loads from a yaml
create tests

make sure everything passes.

when the yamlsweep is accessed it should return a key,value tuple.

if the contents of the yaml changes between runs that should break the cache. 

the example should be a set of named keys and list values.
